<h2><b>Are You Looking At Me?</b>
<h3><i>She most certainly is, and has been since 1994, when photographer Jill
Furmanovsky first clapped lenses on Oasis. Since then, as snapper by appointment,
she has documented their exponential ascent.</b></h3>

<p>Pink Floyd recording Wish You Were Here, 1974; The Clash at the Roxy, 1977;
Pete Burns with a stuffed lion, 1984; she'd done them all, but in 1994 Zimbabwe-born
photographer Jill Furmanovsky was searching for a "really good, young, up-and-coming
band" with which to end The Moment, an impending compilation of a quarter century
of her rock'n'roll pictures.
The quest led her to Cambridge Corn Exchange on December 4 to see the most hyped
band of the minute, spectacularly described in The Moment as "ego-ridden, disrespectful,
uncouth, volatile dangerous, riveting and brilliant". "They won't last," opined
Furmanovsky's notes. "They can't last, but they don't give a toss."
<p>"I'd seen Oasis just once on MTV, so I went along on a recommendation," she
recalls. "I was immediately struck by the contrast between the excitement the band
generated and their lack of performance on stage, which was a real challenge to 
capture. I sent them a bunch of photocopied pictures, and said I wanted to use
a couple. Their reply was really positive, and they seemed keen to have someone
new on board, so I was invited to a video shoot, then to San Francisco, and I
haven't been away from them since."
<p>Furmanovsky's first ever rock photo was taken with an instamatic. The subjects
were two of her schoolfriends and Paul McCartney, lingering outside the Beatle's
St. John's Wood house in 1967. A stint as in-house photographer at London's
legendary Rainbow Theatre venue turned into a career of globetrotting smudgerdom,
but it's apt that Furmanovsky's most intimate liaison should be with The Beatle's
spiritual successors: at the time of writing, Furmanovsky has just shot her 27th
Oasis assignment.
<p>Enough work, in fact, to warrant an entirely Oasis-orientated exhibition, which
starts on September 19th at London's Roundhouse (moving on to Manchester's
Fruit Market on October 15 and Glasglow's Tramway on November 22) and titled
(by Noel himself) Was There Then. Joining standard colour and digitally processed
black-and-white images are holograms, huge projection screens, four-metre-high shots
of the Knebworth crowd and an audio tape compiled by Oasis biographer Paolo
Hewitt comprising Oasis songs and interview snippets. An impressive reflection
of an artistic relationship that began, if truth be told, somewhat inauspiciously.
<p>"Noel thought that I was the caterer," Furmanovsky grins. "He obviously didn't
think for a minute that I was a professional."
<p>Why, then, does she think the band prize her so highly?
<p>"I think it's partially because I work very fast, and they just can't be 
bothered to spend hours on pictures. Noel once said, 'I'm blowed if I'm going 
to stand in front of a camera for two hours when I can write a song in twenty
minutes.'
Also my documentary style suits them quite well- I'm no good at styling sessions
and such.
<p>Anyway, Oasis have their own style.

<h3><b>Hello, Hello...</h3>
<p>US video shoot for Live Forever, <p>Portland Place, London, January
5, 1995
<p></b>
"My first encounter with Liam, which was quite off-putting. I said something like,
'I saw you at Cambridge, and I was struck by how little you did on stage, while
the music was passionate,' and he just looked at me and repeated back what I'd
said to him, in a whiny voice.
So I backed off. But I knew I was still going to have to connect with Liam to be
able to work with the band, and I did make one discovery that day, that we shared
the same birthday, September 21, which helped."

<h3><b>Those First Impressions</h3>
<p>Cambridge Corn Exchange <p>
December 4, 1994</b>
<p>"I'd never seen The Stone Roses, and it wasn't until much later that I realised
that Liam was enormously influenced by Ian Brown, the way he either just sung
or stood there or sat down. I got very excited too- not just because the music
sounded good but because I was interested in the band's strange chemistry, which 
is what you're always looking for, to make it interesting for yourself."

<h3><b>Lights, Camera, Inaction</h3>
 Rehearsal for summer shows, NEC
<p>Birmingham, July 29th, 1996
</b><p>
"A small group of girls were there, between 14 and 15 years old, who turned out
to be daughters of NEC employees who'd asked if they could watch. Quite often 
in the soundcheck, Liam saves his voice for the show itself, so he maybe sings
a couple of numbers, while Noel sings the rest, so that's Liam sitting with the girls,
and they're all watching an Oasis gig, light show and all, on their own."

<h3><b>And This Is One Of Mine...</h3>
<p>Hotel bar, Chester
<p>March 19, 1997
</b>
<p>"The night before they were to do the sleeve for D'You Know What I Mean? we 
were in the hotel bar. Liam had just written a song for The Seahorses and he
just put it on in the bar and played it solidly for the next four and a half hours,
and sang it to everybody. You can see him with his tape machine and he's pressing
play or rewind. 
He sang it to the barman, and to Alan McGee. It was hilarious."
