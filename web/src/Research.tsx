                        <li>The band had gigs all the way up through December 16, 1993.</li>
                        <li>Tony McCarroll states in his book that they were at Monnow Valley after they heard Columbia on the radio for the first time.  The white label demo was aired on December 6, 1993 on BBC Radio One.</li>
                        <li>He also states that the session lasted 18 days.</li>
                        <li>The band recorded Supersonic at The Pink Museum in Liverpool on December 19, 1993, so they wouldn't have been at Monnow Valley at that time.</li>
                        <li>The band recorded a session for BBC Radio One on December 22, 1993 at Maida Vale Studios which was later broadcast on January 4th 1994.</li>

                        <li>The band didn't head to Sawmill Studios sometime until after the Water Rates gig.  Tony McCarroll states in his book that they went from London back to Manchester for one day and then down to Sawmill Studios.</li>
                        <li>Paolo Hewitt states in Getting High that the band went to Olympic Studios to mix the Monnow Valley sessions for a couple days before they realized it wasn't going to work.</li>
                        <li>Anjali Dutt (engineer on the sessions) stated that the Sawmill Studios session didn't start until after the Gleneagles gig (February 6th, 1994) AND the Amsterdam ferry incident (February 17th, 1994).</li>
                        <li>Oasis resuming touring on March 23rd, 1994 in Bedford, UK.  Therefore, the sessions most likely ran from some time after February 17th until some time in mid-March.</li>
                        <li>Tentative dates for the session are February 24, 1994 to March 4, 1994.</li>

                        <li>The video is filmed at three distinct locations:  8 Stratford Avenue in Didsbury (Bonehead's old house), Fog Lane Park and obviously Sifter's Records, all of which are within a 2 mile radius of each other.</li>
                        <li>There may even be a few shots in front of Noel and Liam's childhood house on Cranwell Drive in neighboring Burnage.</li>
                        <li>Based on the flowers and grass visible during the shots in Bonehead's back garden, the video appears to have been filmed in the springtime or early summer, 1994.</li>
                        <li>A check of the band's touring schedule shows that they were on a break from May 15th to June 1, 1994.  They were also on a break from April 14th to April 28th, 1994, but based on the greenery in the video, I am guessing the May timeline makes more sense.</li>
                        <li>The cover to Definitely Maybe is photographed on May 27th at Bonehead's house, so the video shoot would have been on a different day and quite possibly around the same time for logistical reasons.</li>
                        <li>The video was released on June 13th.  As this was their second music video and prior to the release of Definitely Maybe, it most likely did not have a huge budget and was probably filmed in one day.</li>
                        <li>Likely filming date is some time during the last week of May, 1994</li>
