      "He also states that the session lasted 18 days.",
      "The band recorded Supersonic at The Pink Museum in Liverpool on December 19, 1993, so they wouldn't have been at Monnow Valley at that time.",

      "Oasis resuming touring on March 23rd, 1994 in Bedford, UK.  Therefore, the sessions most likely ran from some time after February 17th until some time in mid-March.",

      "The video is filmed at three distinct locations:  8 Stratford Avenue in Didsbury (Bonehead's old house), Fog Lane Park and obviously Sifter's Records, all of which are within a 2 mile radius of each other.",
      "There may even be a few shots in front of Noel and Liam's childhood house on Cranwell Drive in neighboring Burnage.",
      "Based on the flowers and grass visible during the shots in Bonehead's back garden, the video appears to have been filmed in the springtime or early summer, 1994.",
      "A check of the band's touring schedule shows that they were on a break from May 15th to June 1, 1994.  They were also on a break from April 14th to April 28th, 1994, but based on the greenery in the video, I am guessing the May timeline makes more sense.",
      "The cover to Definitely Maybe is photographed on May 27th at Bonehead's house, so the video shoot would have been on a different day and quite possibly around the same time for logistical reasons.",
      "The video was released on June 13th.  As this was their second music video and prior to the release of Definitely Maybe, it most likely did not have a huge budget and was probably filmed in one day.",
      "Likely filming date is some time during the last week of May, 1994"
